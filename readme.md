# Obsidian Acadamic Export
Here you will find an Obsidian css-snippet, which will format pdf-exports as academic writing akin to LaTeX compilation. Simply place `academic-pdf-export.css` in your obsidian snippets folder and activate it in settings. Tested with minimal-theme. Pull-request are very welcome.

This css-snippet uses the 'Latin Modern' font family - a LateX font clone, which can may have to be installed separately, or you can simply change the fonts in the css to something else, e.g. 'Times New Roman'.

## Example
To the left is shown obsidian in source mode, i.e the source code. To the right is the exported pdf.
| Source                           | Build                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![Source 1](images/source_1.png) | ![Build 1](images/build_1.png) |
| ![Source 1](images/source_2.png) | ![Build 1](images/build_2.png) |
| ![Source 1](images/source_3.png) | ![Build 1](images/build_3.png) |

`UI-tweaks.css` will make Obsidian preview mode better resemble what is being exported.
